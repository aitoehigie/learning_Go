===================================
How to structure a Go project
===================================

A directory will hold all your Go programs

This directory should contain a src folder for holding all the source code 
for different programs.
the program named directory will then contain the raw *.go files

See below:

Go_programs/
	src/
		program1/
			main.go
			app.go

Run the following commands in the root of your Go program directory
1. export GOPATH=`pwd`
2. go install <program1>

Command (2) will produce a "bin" directory which will then look like this:
bin/program1

Running "bin/program1" will run your app.
